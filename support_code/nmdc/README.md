Scripts in this folder (support_code/nmdc) are for development and running locally.  They should not be considered the "source of truth" for NMDC's workflows or metadata generation.  

Production workflows and metadata generation scripts source locations:
-  NOM worklfow and metadata generation scripts live in the EnviroMS repository
-  GC-MS metabolomics workflow and metadata generation scripts live in the MetaMS repository
